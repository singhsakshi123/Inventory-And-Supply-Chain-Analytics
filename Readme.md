# 📦 Inventory & Supply Chain Management Analysis (Power BI Dashboard)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Power BI Inventory & Supply Chain dashboard** built to track inventory efficiency, order fulfillment, and logistics performance across **4 product categories** and **4 regions**. The dashboard is designed to provide a clear, executive-level view of operational performance and highlight where inventory or supply chain bottlenecks may be impacting service levels and cost.

---

## 🎯 Business Goal
The goal of this dashboard is to help operations teams answer critical questions such as:
- Are we maintaining healthy inventory levels or facing overstock/stockout risks?
- Which product categories and regions drive higher transportation costs?
- Where are delays happening through longer lead times?
- What is the backorder situation and which order statuses need attention?
- How is sales volume trending over time?

---

## 📊 Analysis Coverage
This dashboard majorly analyzes:
- **4 Product Categories:** Accessories, Clothing, Electronics, Furniture  
- **4 Regions:** North, South, East, West  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)
Key transformation steps completed in **Power Query** include:
- Removed blank/duplicate records to ensure accurate reporting  
- Standardized data types (dates, numeric fields, category labels)  
- Corrected inconsistent naming for regions and product categories  
- Created a clean model-ready dataset for reporting and DAX calculations
